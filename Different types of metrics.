                             Different types of metrics
Types of Test Metrics:
1. Process Metrics: Measure the testing process itself, such as:
    - Test Coverage: Percentage of code or functionality covered by tests
    - Test Execution Time: Time taken to execute tests
    - Defect Detection Rate: Number of defects found per unit of time
2. Product Metrics: Measure the quality of the product, such as:
    - Defect Density: Number of defects per unit of code or functionality
    - Mean Time To Detect (MTTD): Average time taken to detect a defect
    - Mean Time To Fix (MTTF): Average time taken to fix a defect
3. Project Metrics: Measure project progress and status, such as:
    - Test Progress: Percentage of tests executed
    - Defect Fix Rate: Number of defects fixed per unit of time
