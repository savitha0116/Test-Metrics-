                                            Test Metrics
Test Metrics are quantitative measures used to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of software testing. They help teams identify areas for improvement, optimize testing processes, and ensure high-quality products.
Examples:
1. Test Coverage: 80% of code covered by unit tests, 60% by integration tests
2. Defect Density: 0.5 defects per KLOC (thousand lines of code)
3. MTTD: 2 hours to detect a defect
4. Test Execution Time: 4 hours to execute 1000 tests
